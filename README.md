## CPU Scheduling Simulator (Round Robin & FCFS)

This project is a Python-based CPU scheduling simulator that dynamically executes either **Round Robin** or **First Come First Serve (FCFS)** scheduling based on the selected time quantum.

The program supports **arrival times**, **idle CPU intervals**, and provides a detailed **Gantt Chart visualization** along with key scheduling performance metrics.

### Features
- Dynamic selection between Round Robin and FCFS
- User-defined time quantum
- Support for arrival times (including idle CPU handling)
- Calculates:
  - Waiting Time (WT)
  - Turnaround Time (TAT)
  - Response Time (RT)
  - Context Switch Count
- Text-based Gantt Chart visualization
- Input validation and interactive CLI

### Technologies
- Python 3
- Threading and animations for enhanced CLI experience

### Use Case
This project is intended for **Operating Systems coursework**, **algorithm visualization**, and **conceptual understanding of CPU scheduling techniques**.
